# Training Stage Calculations in Spam Detection Model ðŸ§®

## Core Calculation Components

### 1. Text Preprocessing
```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove special characters and convert to lowercase
    preprocessed = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text.lower()).strip()
    return preprocessed
```
**Calculation Steps**:
- Remove non-alphabetic characters
- Convert to lowercase
- Strip whitespace

### 2. Feature Extraction
```python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_processed)
```
**Calculation Mechanics**:
- Create vocabulary of unique words
- Count word frequencies in each email
- Transform text to numerical matrix
- Each row represents an email
- Each column represents a unique word
- Values represent word count

## Probabilistic Calculations

### Naive Bayes Probability Computation

#### 1. Prior Probability Calculation
```python
# Probability of an email being spam or not spam
P(spam) = (number of spam emails) / (total number of emails)
P(not_spam) = (number of not spam emails) / (total number of emails)
```

#### 2. Likelihood Calculation
```python
# Probability of a word appearing in spam/not spam emails
P(word | spam) = (word count in spam emails) / (total words in spam emails)
P(word | not_spam) = (word count in not spam emails) / (total words in not spam emails)
```

#### 3. Posterior Probability
```python
# Probability of an email being spam given its words
P(spam | email) = P(email | spam) * P(spam) / P(email)
```

## Training Stage Workflow

### Detailed Calculation Process
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Clean and standardize email text
   - Remove noise and irrelevant characters

2. **Vectorization**
   - Convert text to numerical representation
   - Create word frequency matrix

3. **Probability Estimation**
   - Calculate word probabilities
   - Compute class probabilities
   - Build probabilistic model

## Mathematical Representation

### Bayes' Theorem Application
```
P(Spam | Words) = 
    P(Words | Spam) * P(Spam)
    ------------------------
           P(Words)
```

### Logarithmic Transformation
```python
# Log probabilities to prevent underflow
log_prob_spam = sum(log(P(word | spam)) for word in email)
log_prob_not_spam = sum(log(P(word | not_spam)) for word in email)
```

## Code Implementation
```python
class SpamDetector:
    def train(self, X_train, y_train):
        # Preprocess emails
        X_processed = [self.preprocess_text(email) for email in X_train]
        
        # Vectorize text
        X_vectorized = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(X_processed)
        
        # Train Naive Bayes classifier
        self.classifier.fit(X_vectorized, y_train)
```

## Model Type Clarification

### Current Implementation

- **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **NOT a Deep Learning Model**

### Architectural Choices
- Probabilistic text classification
- Simple, efficient feature extraction
- Lightweight computational model

**Note**: Deep learning is a potential future direction, not the current implementation.
