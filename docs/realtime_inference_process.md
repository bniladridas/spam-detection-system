# Real-Time Spam Detection Inference 🚀

## 🔍 Inference Stage Architecture

### Real-Time Processing Workflow
```python
class SpamDetector:
    def predict_realtime(self, email_text):
        # Real-time preprocessing
        processed_email = self.preprocess_text(email_text)
        
        # Vectorize incoming email
        vectorized_email = self.vectorizer.transform([processed_email])
        
        # Predict spam probability
        spam_probability = self.classifier.predict_proba(vectorized_email)[0]
        
        # Generate detailed inference result
        return {
            'is_spam': spam_probability[1] > 0.5,
            'spam_probability': spam_probability[1],
            'not_spam_probability': spam_probability[0],
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
```

## 📊 Real-Time Processing Components

### 1. Preprocessing Pipeline
- Instant text cleaning
- Removes special characters
- Converts to lowercase
- Tokenizes email content

### 2. Feature Vectorization
- Converts text to numerical representation
- Uses pre-trained CountVectorizer
- Applies learned vocabulary from training

### 3. Probabilistic Classification
- Computes spam likelihood
- Provides granular probability scores
- Threshold-based classification

## 🧠 Inference Mechanics

### Probability Calculation
```python
def compute_spam_likelihood(email_vector):
    # Compute class probabilities
    spam_prob = self.classifier.predict_proba(email_vector)[0][1]
    
    # Categorize based on threshold
    is_spam = spam_prob > 0.5
    
    return {
        'spam_probability': spam_prob,
        'is_spam': is_spam
    }
```

## 🚨 Real-Time Decision Making

### Classification Thresholds
- Spam Threshold: 0.5
- Probabilities range: 0.0 - 1.0
- Granular spam detection

### Decision Matrix
```
Probability Range | Classification
0.0 - 0.3         | Likely Not Spam
0.3 - 0.5         | Suspicious
0.5 - 0.7         | Potential Spam
0.7 - 1.0         | High Spam Likelihood
```

## Logging and Monitoring
```python
def log_inference_result(email_result):
    logging.info(f"Inference Result: {json.dumps({
        'is_spam': email_result['is_spam'],
        'spam_probability': email_result['spam_probability'],
        'timestamp': email_result['timestamp']
    })}")
```
