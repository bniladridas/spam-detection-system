# Relationships and Weights in Spam Detection Training üåê

## üîç Discovering Word-Class Relationships

### Relationship Mapping
```python
# Conceptual representation of word-class relationships
word_spam_relationships = {
    'free': {'spam_weight': 0.85, 'not_spam_weight': 0.15},
    'meeting': {'spam_weight': 0.05, 'not_spam_weight': 0.95},
    'urgent': {'spam_weight': 0.75, 'not_spam_weight': 0.25},
    'project': {'spam_weight': 0.10, 'not_spam_weight': 0.90}
}
```

## üìä Weight Calculation Process

### 1. Word Frequency Analysis
- Count word occurrences in spam and not spam emails
- Calculate relative frequency for each word
- Determine predictive power of words

### 2. Probability Weight Computation
```python
def calculate_word_weights(emails, labels):
    # Initialize word frequency dictionaries
    spam_word_freq = {}
    not_spam_word_freq = {}
    
    # Iterate through emails
    for email, label in zip(emails, labels):
        words = email.split()
        for word in words:
            if label == 'spam':
                spam_word_freq[word] = spam_word_freq.get(word, 0) + 1
            else:
                not_spam_word_freq[word] = not_spam_word_freq.get(word, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate weights
    word_weights = {}
    for word in set(list(spam_word_freq.keys()) + list(not_spam_word_freq.keys())):
        spam_freq = spam_word_freq.get(word, 0)
        not_spam_freq = not_spam_word_freq.get(word, 0)
        
        total_freq = spam_freq + not_spam_freq
        spam_weight = spam_freq / total_freq
        not_spam_weight = not_spam_freq / total_freq
        
        word_weights[word] = {
            'spam_weight': spam_weight,
            'not_spam_weight': not_spam_weight
        }
    
    return word_weights
```

## üß† Key Relationship Insights

### Spam Indicator Words
| Word       | Spam Weight | Not Spam Weight | Interpretation |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 'free'     | 0.85        | 0.15            | Strong spam indicator |
| 'urgent'   | 0.75        | 0.25            | High spam probability |
| 'winner'   | 0.80        | 0.20            | Likely spam |
| 'meeting'  | 0.05        | 0.95            | Likely legitimate |
| 'project'  | 0.10        | 0.90            | Professional context |

## üî¨ Relationship Types

### 1. Linguistic Relationships
- Words associated with spam language
- Patterns in email structure
- Contextual word usage

### 2. Probabilistic Relationships
- Word occurrence probabilities
- Class-specific word distributions
- Predictive power of individual words

## üìà Weight Interpretation

### Spam Weight Calculation
- Higher weight ‚Üí Stronger spam indication
- Closer to 1.0 ‚Üí More likely to be in spam emails
- Closer to 0.0 ‚Üí More likely to be in legitimate emails

### Visualization of Weights
```
Spam Weight Scale:
0.0 -------- 0.5 -------- 1.0
Legitimate  Neutral     Spam
```

## üß© Practical Example

### Training Set Analysis
```python
training_emails = [
    'Urgent! You\'ve won a free iPhone. Click here now!',
    'Meeting scheduled for next week. Please confirm.',
    'Limited offer: Get rich quick with this amazing investment!',
    'Hi, can we discuss the project timeline?'
]

training_labels = ['spam', 'not_spam', 'spam', 'not_spam']

# Calculate word weights
word_weights = calculate_word_weights(training_emails, training_labels)
```

## üöß Limitations

### Relationship Discovery Constraints
- Small dataset limitations
- Potential bias in word representation
- Oversimplification of language complexity
- Assumes word independence

## üöÄ Improvement Strategies

1. Expand training dataset
2. Implement advanced feature engineering
3. Use context-aware weight calculations
4. Incorporate machine learning techniques
5. Regular model retraining

## üí° Advanced Considerations

### Deep Learning Approach
- Neural network-based relationship learning
- Contextual word embeddings
- More nuanced weight calculations
